# Responsive - pt_BR branch (UNOFFICIAL)

## A powerful, accessible, developer friendly framework for building responsive websites

### UNOFFICIAL Portuguese translation
The process is being splitted into three chunks:

1) Raw translation
    - Literal and free translation
    
2) Improvement 
    - Context checking
    - Spell and grammar checking
    - Proofreading

3) Adaptation to the docs format        
        

See below the details.

### Contributing
Contributions are really appreciated. This branch strives to follow the [guidelines for contributing to Responsive](https://github.com/lsrdg/Responsive/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
Even if you don't speak Portuguese, your ideas and insights are welcomed.

### 1) Raw translation
On the left, the name in English, as you can find on the original repository.
On the right, the name in Brazilian Portuguese, as you will eventually find on this branch (`pt`).

### Preview with Jekyll Server
It might be necessary to prepend `bundle exec` to preview it locally. The 
Gemfile was modified slightly modified, the original one can be found [here](https://github.com/ResponsiveBP/Responsive/blob/gh-pages/Gemfile).

If you already have a local copy of the `gh-pages` branch, you just substitute a
HTML file with the translated one, downloaded from the `pt` branch.

### Differences between repositories
On this repository: 

- `pt` is the master branch
- Modified Gemfile 
- Still with mixed filenames [!]
