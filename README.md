# Responsive - pt_BR branch (UNOFFICIAL)

## A powerful, accessible, developer friendly framework for building responsive websites

### UNOFFICIAL Portuguese translation
The process is being splitted into three chunks:

1) Raw translation
    - Literal and free translation
2) Improvement 
    - Context checking
    - Spell and grammar checking
    - Proofreading
3) Adaptation to the docs format	
 	

See below the details.

### Contributing

Even if you don't speak Portuguese, your ideas and insights are welcomed.
